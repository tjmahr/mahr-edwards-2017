## License

I am not a lawyer, but I would describe the layout of ownership here as follows: The article is copyrighted by the journal, although it does not appear in its accepted or published anywhere in this repository. The R scripts and RMarkdown files in this repository are the same ones that I used to produce the article. Thus, a motivated R user could reproduce the accepted version of the article. This is a good thing because every single result in the article is reproducible. 

For the things that are *not* the article, I would say: The GPL-3 license applies to the R code I have written in the .R and .Rmd files. The data, collected at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, still belong to the university.

  abstract = {Children learn words by listening to caregivers, and the 
              quantity and quality of early language input predict later 
              language development. Recent research suggests that word 
              recognition efficiency may influence the relationship between 
              input and vocabulary growth. We asked whether language input 
              and lexical processing at 28–39 months predicted vocabulary 
              size one year later in 109 preschoolers. Input was measured 
              using adult word counts from LENA recordings. We used the 
              visual world paradigm and measured lexical processing as the 
              rate of change in proportion of looks to target. Regression 
              analysis showed that lexical processing did not constrain the 
              effect of input on vocabulary size. We also found that input 
              and processing were more reliable predictors of receptive than 
              expressive vocabulary growth.}
