Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Children learn words by listening to caregivers, and the quantity and
> quality of early language input predict later language development.
> Recent research suggests that word recognition efficiency may
> influence the relationship between input and vocabulary growth. We
> asked whether language input and lexical processing at 28â€“39 months
> predicted vocabulary size one year later in 109 preschoolers. Input
> was measured using adult word counts from LENA recordings. We used the
> visual world paradigm and measured lexical processing as the rate of
> change in proportion of looks to target. Regression analysis showed
> that lexical processing did not constrain the effect of input on
> vocabulary size. We also found that input and processing were more
> reliable predictors of receptive than expressive vocabulary growth.
