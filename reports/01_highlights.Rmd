Research highlights
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - We examine how home language input and word recognition efficiency
    at 28â€“39 months predict vocabulary size one year later.
  - Word recognition efficiency does not constrain the effect of home
    language input on word learning at this age.
  - Receptive vocabulary is more sensitive to variability in language
    input and lexical processing than expressive vocabulary.
