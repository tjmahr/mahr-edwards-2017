`reports`
========================================================================

Each `.Rmd` here is a part of the manuscript.

`00_report.Rmd` says how the the parts should be combined.

`compile_report.R` compiles the report into a GitHub flavored markdown
file, an HTML file, and a Microsoft word file.

`assets` contains files needed to make the output formats including the
bibliography (`refs.bib`).
