              accept a single model on the basis of only the ``raw'' AIC
              values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the
              observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such
              as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be
              easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike,
              1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which
              can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each
              model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly
              facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model

              cross-linguistic study of word-initial lingual obstruents examined some

              Repetitions of real words were elicited from 2- and 3-year-old children

              at 24–31 months continued to have weaker language and reading skills at
              17 years of age than typically developing peers. Method: Language and
              reading outcomes at 17 years of age were examined in 26 children
              identified as late talkers with normal nonverbal ability and normal
              receptive language at intake and in 23 typically developing children
              matched at intake on age, socioeconomic status (SES), and nonverbal
              ability. Results: Although late talkers performed in the average range
              on all language and reading tasks at 17 years of age, they obtained
              significantly lower Vocabulary/ Grammar and Verbal Memory factor scores
              than SES-matched peers. The age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar factor had large
              correlations with the age 17 Verbal Memory and Reading/Writing factors.
              The age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar and Reading/Writing factors were strongly
              predicted by comparable factors at 13 years of age. Age 2 Language
              Development Survey ( L. Rescorla, 1989) vocabulary score explained
              17{\%} of the variance in the age 17 Vocabulary/Grammar and Verbal
              Memory factors. Conclusions: Results suggest that slow language
              development at 24–31 months is associated with a weakness in
              language-related skills into adolescence relative to skills manifested
              by typically developing peers—findings that are consistent with a

              towards the end of the first year of life. Not only does
              non-native speech perception decline, as often shown, but
              native language speech perception skills show improvement,
              reflecting a facilitative effect of experience with native
              language. The mechanism underlying change at this point
              in development, and the relationship between the change in
              native and non-native speech perception, is of theoretical
              interest. As shown in new data presented here, at the cusp
              of this developmental change, infants' native and non-native
              phonetic perception skills predict later language ability,
              but in opposite directions. Better native language skill
              at 7.5 months of age predicts faster language advancement,
              whereas better non-native language skill predicts slower
              advancement. We suggest that native language phonetic
              performance is indicative of neural commitment to the
              native language, while non-native phonetic performance
              reveals uncommitted neural circuitry. This paper has three

              development, (ii) to present new event-related potential

              paper reports evidence regarding (1) the nature of those environmental
              requirements, (2) the ways in which the varied social contexts in which

              support language acquisition by providing children with opportunities
              for communicative experience, which motivate the language acquisition
              process, and a language model, which serves as data for the language
              acquisition mechanism. Different environments do so to different

              a log probability function over parameters conditioned on
              specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan
              provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable
              models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as
              the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian
              Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood
              estimates are calculated using optimization methods such
              as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
              algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log
              densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be
              used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes,
              expectation propagation, and marginal inference using
              approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so
              that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with
              intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance
              probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called
              from the command line using the cmdstan package, through
              R using the rstan package, and through Python using the
              pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and
              optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior
              analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log
              probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms,

              development of children's skill in real-time language processing and

              child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words
              in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24
              months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to
              vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of
              child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants'
              language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language

              processing in infancy, Fernald, Perfors and Marchman (2006) found that
              reaction time at 25 months was strongly related to lexical and
              grammatical development over the second year. In this follow-up study,
              children originally tested as infants were assessed at 8 years on
              standardized tests of language, cognition, and working memory. Speed of
              spoken word recognition and vocabulary size at 25 months each accounted
              for unique variance in linguistic and cognitive skills at 8 years,
              effects that were attributable to strong relations between both infancy
              measures and working memory. These findings suggest that processing
              speed and early language skills are fundamental to intellectual
              functioning, and that language development is guided by learning and
              representational principles shared across cognitive and linguistic

               individual differences in vocabulary depend, in large part, on
               variations in learning capacity. However, variations in exposure have
               not been systematically explored. In this study vocabulary growth rates
               are characterized for each of 22 children by using data obtained at
               several time points from 14 to 26 mo. A substantial relation between
               individual differences in vocabulary acquisition and variations in the
               amount that particular mothers speak to their children was found. It is
               argued that the relation between amount of parent speech and vocabulary
               growth reflects parent effects on the child, rather than child-ability
               effects on the parent or hereditary factors. It was also found that
               gender is an important factor in rate of vocabulary growth.},

              development from 12 to 25 months. Analyses of growth curves showed that

  abstract = {It is well established that variation in caregivers' speech
              is associated with language outcomes, yet little is known about the
              learning principles that mediate these effects. This longitudinal study
              (n = 27) explores whether Spanish-learning children's early experiences
              with language predict efficiency in real-time comprehension and
              vocabulary learning. Measures of mothers' speech at 18 months were
              examined in relation to children's speech processing efficiency and
              reported vocabulary at 18 and 24 months. Children of mothers who
              provided more input at 18 months knew more words and were faster in word
              recognition at 24 months. Moreover, multiple regression analyses
              indicated that the influences of caregiver speech on speed of word
              recognition and vocabulary were largely overlapping. This study provides
              the first evidence that input shapes children's lexical processing
              efficiency and that vocabulary growth and increasing facility in spoken
              word comprehension work together to support the uptake of the
              information that rich input affords the young language learner.},

              regression (MLR) to analyze data from ‘visual world’ eyetracking
              experiments used in psycholinguistic research. The MLR framework
              overcomes some of the problems with conventional analyses, making it
              possible to incorporate time as a continuous variable and gaze location
              as a categorical dependent variable. The multilevel approach minimizes
              the need for data aggregation and thus provides a more statistically
              powerful approach. With MLR, the researcher builds a mathematical model
              of the overall response curve that separates the response into different
              temporal components. The researcher can test hypotheses by examining the
              impact of independent variables and their interactions on these
              components. A worked example using MLR is provided.},
